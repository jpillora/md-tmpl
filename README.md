# md-tmpl

Simple markdown templating using shell commands

:warning: If you only need to `cat` files, please use https://github.com/campoy/embedmd instead.

### Install

**Binaries**

See [Releases](https://github.com/jpillora/md-tmpl/releases)

**Source**

```sh
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/md-tmpl
```

### Usage

```
$ mk-tmpl
```

```plain

  Usage: md-tmpl [options] [files...]

  Options:
  --preview, -p  Enables preview mode. Displays all commands encountered.
  --write, -w    Write file instead of printing to standard out
  --help, -h

```

Insert templates in the form:

```xml
<!--tmpl,options:command --><!--/tmpl-->
```

where `command` is a shell command and `option`s are listed below

#### Options

- `chomp` - trims any trailing newline generated by `command`
- `code` - wraps the output of `command` in triple backticks

### Examples

Create a `foo.md` with a template tag

```markdown
_Updated on <!--tmpl,chomp:date --><!--/tmpl-->_
```

Then you execute the templates and rewrite `foo.md` with:

```
$ md-tmpl -w foo.md
```

Now, `foo.md` should be:

```markdown
_Updated on <!--tmpl,chomp:date -->Sun 31 Mar 2019 00:41:18 AEDT<!--/tmpl-->_
```

And appear will <!-- tmpl, chomp: --> test <!-- /tmpl --> display on Github, like:

_Updated on <!--tmpl,chomp:date -->Sun 31 Mar 2019 00:41:18 AEDT<!--/tmpl-->_

### More Examples

- Dynamic examples (`cat examples/foo`)
- Usage text (`prog --help`)
- Update timestamps (`date`)

### :warning: Warnings

- Malicious tags. Commands are run by piping strings straight into `bash`. If you think someone has slipped a `rm -rf /` in one of your markdown files, you can view all nested commands with the `--preview, -p` option.
- Currently it has only been tested on Markdown hosted on Github (GFM).
