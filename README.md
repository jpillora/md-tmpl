```
$ mk-tmpl

	Read more:
	  https://github.com/jpillora/md-tmpl

```

Insert templates in the form:

``` xml
<tmpl,option,option:command></tmpl>
```

where `command` is a shell command and `option`s are listed below

#### Options

* `chomp` - trims any trailing newline generated by `command`
* `code` - wraps the output of `command` in triple backticks

### Examples

Create a `foo.md` with a template tag

``` markdown
*Updated on <tmpl,chomp:date></tmpl>*
```

Then run:

```
$ md-tmpl foo.md
```

Now, `foo.md` should be:

``` markdown
*Updated on <tmpl,chomp:date>Mon 16 Mar 2015 22:53:44 AEDT</tmpl>*
```

And appear will display on Github, like:

*Updated on <tmpl,chomp:date>Mon 16 Mar 2015 22:53:44 AEDT</tmpl>*

### More Examples

* Dynamic examples (`cat examples/foo`)
* Usage text (`prog --help`)
* Update timestamps (`date`)

### :warning: Warnings

* Malicious tags. Commands are run by piping strings straight into `bash`. If you think someone has slipped a `rm -rf /` in one of your markdown files, you can view all nested commands with the `--preview, -p` option.
* Currently it has only been tested on Markdown hosted on Github.
* You cannot use `>` in your commands as that will close the tag, use `&gt;` instead.
